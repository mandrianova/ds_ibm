## Libraries for Data Science

### Scientific Computing Libraries in Python

* **Pandas:** Data structures and tools for effective data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.
* **NumPy:** Based on arrays and matrices, allows application of mathematical functions.

### Visualization Libraries in Python

* **Matplotlib:** Well-known library for creating customizable graphs and plots.
* **Seaborn:** Generates heat maps, time series, and violin plots.

### High-Level Machine Learning and Deep Learning Libraries

* **Scikit-learn:** Tools for statistical modeling including regression, classification, and clustering.
* **Keras:** Allows building standard deep learning models in a quick and simple manner.
* **TensorFlow:** Low-level framework for large-scale production of deep learning models.
* **Pytorch:** Simple for researchers to test deep learning ideas.

### Libraries in Other Languages

* **Apache Spark:** General-purpose cluster-computing framework for processing data using compute clusters.
* **Python, R, Scala, SQL:** Apache Spark data processing can be done in these languages.
* **Vegas:** Scala library for statistical data visualizations.
* **ggplot2:** Popular R library for data visualization.

## Data Sets - Powering Data Science

**Definition of a Data Set:**

* A data set is a structured collection of data represented as text, numbers, or media.
* Tabular data sets are common, stored in formats like CSV.
* CSV: Delimited text file with rows and columns separated by commas.

**Types of Data Ownership:**

* Traditionally, data sets were private due to sensitive information.
* Proprietary or confidential data was not shared publicly.

**Sources of Data:**

* Data shared publicly as "open data" by various entities like governments.
* Organizations provide datasets covering diverse areas for public access.

**Community Data License Agreement:**

* Created by the Linux Foundation to address data sharing concerns.
* Offers CDLA-Sharing and CDLA-Permissive licenses for data sharing.
  * **CDLA-Sharing License:** Allows use and modification of data with conditions on publishing modified versions.
  * **CDLA-Permissive License:** Grants usage rights with no obligation to share modifications.
