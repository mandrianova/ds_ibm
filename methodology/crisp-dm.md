## Introduction to CRISP-DM

**CRISP-DM Definition:** CRISP-DM stands for Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining, providing a structured approach for data mining projects.

**Six Stages of CRISP-DM:**

* **Business Understanding:** Defines the project intentions and goals, crucial for project success.
* **Data Understanding:** Combines data requirements, data collection, and data understanding into one stage.
* **Data Preparation:** Transforms collected data into usable subsets and addresses missing data values.
* **Modeling:** Develops data models to reveal patterns and structures within the data.
* **Evaluation:** Tests the selected model's effectiveness and assesses its performance.
* **Deployment:** Integrates the model into operational systems to provide insights on new data.

**Iterative Nature of CRISP-DM:** The model is flexible, allowing revisits to earlier stages for adjustments.

**Feedback Stage:** In John Rollins Data Science methodology, this stage is explicitly named the Feedback stage, aligning with the post-deployment evaluation with stakeholders.
